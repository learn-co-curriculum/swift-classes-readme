## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Blah blah blah


## What the student can do at this point 

* More stuff


## Outline / Notes

*  If we want to create variables that represent a person, we know how to do that:

```swift
let name = "Michael"
var favoriteSong = "Piano Man"
var address = "California"
var hungerScale = 5 // scale is from 1-10, 10 being very hungry
var canSurf = false
```

* Here we created a constant `name` of type `String` with a value of "Michael"
* A variable `favoriteSong` of type `String` with a value of "Piano Man"
* A variable `address` of type `String` with a value of "California"
* A variable `hungerScale` of type `Int` with a value of 5
* A variable `canSurf` of type `Bool` with a value of false
* If all of a sudden.. by a miracle, Michael was able to surf, we know how we can change that variable:

```swift
canSurf = true
```

* What if you had to create 5 people.. or 50 people in your app. Sure you could do it similar to how we did it above, but that would be incredibly tedious.
